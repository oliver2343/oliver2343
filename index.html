           Its a dream similar to chronicles of narnia.<br />
           So anyway, here is where it all started...</p>
<br />
<br />
        <h1>Chapter one<br />
            nearly electrocuted
        </h1>
<br />
<br />
    <p>One time when I was in the car with my aunt Addy, my mom, and my dad.<br />
       We were heading to my step grandma Eleni's house for my sisters birthday.<br />
       When we got there I asked my aunt Addy "Hey wanna explore the secret boiler room with me?".<br />
       So she said "Sure Just le' me let the others know,"<br />
       "Okay," I replied.<br />
       So when we went in, The door slammed shut! "Let us out!" I yelled,<br>
       "Were trapped!" Addy replied,<br>
         "Look at what I found!" I said excitedly.<br>
       We found 2 pieces of broken circuits, and a radio.<br>
       "It looks like one of those puzzles Just like in zelda a link to the past!" I said.<br>
       "Yeah!" Addy replied, "It even has a riddle!" She said.<br>
         "The riddle says: "Connect the wires then you will seek a voice"." I replied.<br>
        So we connected the wires, "Nothing happened," I said as I picked up the radio.<br>
        "Hello? Is anyone th- *Makes buzzing sound like being electrocuted*" I got shocked!, "Ow!" I screamed.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Chapter 2<br>
    The contact</h1>
<br>
<br>
    <p>"Are you okay?" Addy asked, "Yeah" I replied.<br>
    "Bzz Bzz" the radio was buzzing!<br>
    "Hello testing testing Hello I'm listening!"<br>
    someone on the walkie talkie said.<br>
    "We can here you can you here me?" Me and addy said.
    "I can here you, my name is Jake, I can be your guide to the boiler room!" Jake said.<br>
    "Hey, you have my dads name his name is Jake too!" I replied.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Chapter 3<br>
    Wepons?</h1>
<br>
<br>
    <p>"Ok so you see that starecase to your north?" Jake asked, "Yeah," We replied.<br>
    "Head down there you should see a chest full of wepons!" Jake said, "Cool! Wich means there will be monsters?" I asked,<br>
    "Yup!" Jake replied.<br>
